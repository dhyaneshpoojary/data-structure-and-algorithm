/**
 *A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].
 *
 * Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
 * Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * [[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]
 *
 * Output:
 * 2
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
 * Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
 *
 * Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * [[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]
 *
 * Output:
 * 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
 * Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
 * Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
 * Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
 *
 * Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
